# CanvasBoard
A Real-Time note writing and sketching WebApp

I have Developed basic Canvas board functionalities such as writing,
erasing, downloading the canvas, adding notes (with minimising, closing,
dragging it around the page. Uploading the image ( features same as of
notes), undo and redo actions.) Added real- time drawing functionality
using SOCKET.IO by connecting to server using EXPRESS.JS
Created Undo-redo features for the board using Array as Stack by storing
positions, colours and width of the pen and eraser.
